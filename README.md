# RFID-Based-FASTAG-System
FASTAG is a tag attached to a vehicle that allows easy passage through  toll gates to take place. The tag deducts toll charges automatically from  a prepaid account once the vehicle passes a toll. This gives vehicles a  fast commuting option avoiding stopping for a cash transaction.
The project’s aim is to demonstrate a simple version of the FASTAG  system with the help of an RFID tag that alerts the toll gate to open  when a car is about to pass by.


When a car with a FASTAG ID (RFID tag attached) is approaching the toll  gate, the FASTAG reader (RFID sensor), the tag number is authenticated  and the gate is opened. If the tag is wrong (not authorized), the gate will not open. The  gate remains open until the car completely passes by, ensuring safety of  the car (with the help of IR Sensor).

Software: Arduino IDE (Customized Java)
